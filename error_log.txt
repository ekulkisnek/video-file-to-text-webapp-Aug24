With the new biology clinic, it's not about quick fixes and suppressing symptoms. The practitioners take time to understand your unique story, recognizing that health is unique to the
Chunk 145/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  invasive treatments with unpleasant side effects. If this sounds all too familiar, consider a different approach with the new biology clinic founded by Dr. Tom Cowan, or respected natural health doctor, author, and speaker. Dr. Cowan's holistic perspective on health and wellness
Chunk 144/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  with modern health systems, you're waiting months for appointments only to spend a mere 10 minutes with a doctor who quickly hands out a generic diagnosis that is likely rooted in a total misunderstanding of health and causes. Then you're offered a one size fits all medication or an

Also be sure to head to the show notes to check out our membership offerings, membership marketplace, and more. In nearly all cases,
Chunk 142/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  part of it. And when you move with it, you're moving with everything that's relevant. So this is just when we saw this, we're like, if you're enjoying this episode, please consider sharing it with at least one friend.
Chunk 141/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  to move with the earth. We are part of this planet. We are not some separate beings living in kind of, no, we are part of this incredible being called the earth. We are part of it. The same
Chunk 140/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  I think that we're even though things look crazy on the outside, I really believe that we're moving in a beautiful direction. And you want to be moving electromagnetically with it. You want
Chunk 139/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  you're moving with it. And that makes the whole difference in the world. So this is the core of Anilema. This is what it does. There is a huge change happening on this planet. Planet is moving forward. I
Chunk 138/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  you in a powerful way to your relevant electromagnetic environment. This is what we need now in this point in time. You move with the Earth and not separate from it.
Chunk 137/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  This is what it does to us. When you drink in a lemon water, you are, you know how in this day and age, we're disconnected from ourselves and disconnected from basically everything, people, everything. This connects
Chunk 136/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  of life to the circadian rhythm of nature. It connected the seed, electromagnetic, it tweets a larger, relevant environment. And this
Chunk 135/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  And we couldn't figure it out, we connected to other scientists and after a while we realized that it started to follow the tide. So an animal water connected this tiny piece of water.
Chunk 134/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  It was weird. You just sprinkled a couple of drops of anolema water and you started seeing this happening. It's like the seeds started to breathe a light in a very long, long way. And
Chunk 133/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  regular water within the sea nothing special. But almost as soon as we started watering seeds with anilemo water, we started seeing this sinusoidal shape of peaks and valleys of biofault and emissions. Why?
Chunk 132/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  and we took seeds, it's tiny pieces of life. I mean like it cannot be more simple than that. And we watered some with regular water and some with an LMO water. And we monitored bio-photony missions. And seeds that were watered with
Chunk 131/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  effects on helping us. But I'm going to touch upon now what we feel it's all about. So anyhow, early on, we were doing research on these biophoton emissions.
Chunk 130/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  So I'm going to mention this study that we did, which is really, really, really extraordinary and really kind of showcases. To be honest, this is what it's all about. All of these other studies, which definitively prove powerful.
Chunk 129/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  to witness all of this, you have a responsibility to do the very best that you can to bring this information into the world in the pureest possible way.
Chunk 128/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  My whole thing is just to do the whole project just this because when you witness, and I'm going to come into some really crazy, I'm going to mention this study which really kind of blew our minds.
Chunk 127/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  the very same thing. Beautiful. So well said. So well said. I mean, you're, uh, you've got to be a perfect steward of water if you're communicating on behalf of this product. So it makes, it makes sense that you're.
Chunk 126/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  powerful and very tangible way. What will pick it up and what will store it? That's why it's so important how we treat water and since 99% of our molecules of water, how we treat each other is
Chunk 125/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  I'm literally changing their biology. When you understand that, you cannot behave in the same way. You just cannot. Because you know that you are impacting another human being. You know.
Chunk 124/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  show up with people has a powerful quantum and actually very real effect on the biology of a human being. So if I'm sending kindness, if I'm sending love to people,
Chunk 123/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  And what always picks up the most dominant frequency of the environment and it stores it. When you become aware of that, you know that you how you show up in the world, how you show up in the world, how you show up in the world.
Chunk 122/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  Everything happens through it. That's why it's so important. You know, it's totally cool to me how water teaches us to be kind. Because we are 99% water.
Chunk 121/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  And water being the absorber receiver and transmitter of energy frequency and vibration, it's at the very heart of our biology.
Chunk 120/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  The greatest scientist of all time, at least in my eye, Nikola Tesla, he said, like, if you want to know the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy frequency and vibrancy.
Chunk 119/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  the week in coherent chaotic water to help bring it into coherence as you're stirring it with the one. We've said it perfectly. So thank you so much for that. It's exactly the way it is. And you know,
Chunk 118/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  a strong coherent water and it has a strong coherent field since it is so, let's say, electrically charged. It's probably not the correct term, but it itself has a strong coherent field that is then overtaking an entrant.
Chunk 117/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  have to say. So Eileen McEusek said says a strong coherent field will always overtake and entrain a weak and coherent field. So I'd imagine the water inside of this quartz encasing is
Chunk 116/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  So it's transmitting its harmonious energy into the water that you're stirring and then you then consume that and you're consuming more coherent water. And I've said this quote like a thousand times in recent episodes, but it's always so relevant.
Chunk 115/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  So basically the water inside of this animal wand is we could say teaching the water that you stir it with via this quartz encase.
Chunk 114/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  possible way that there could be something physically transmitted between the two cultures just to quartz encasing between the two. One culture was able to transmit information to the other cultures. So quartz, as we know, like you said, is a superconductor. Yes. So
Chunk 113/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  from the 1970s and 80s, where they would manipulate some things in a cell culture. And then there was a quartz pain in between two different cell cultures, essentially, only manipulating one of them with no
Chunk 112/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  is coherent water encased in a quartz encasing, right? And quartz acts as a super conductor. Super conductor, right? So, and then that's why they use cell phones and things like this, and there's some interesting studies in Russia.
Chunk 111/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  are to function properly. So I think it makes total sense what you've got here. So let me, let me see if I can summarize the sort of mechanism of action as best I can for the audience and layman's terms. So what we have here.
Chunk 110/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  and that we are comprised likely a fourth phase water. It would make sense that we would want to introduce more coherent water and that we would want to drink coherent water in order for the bodies of water that we would want to drink.
Chunk 109/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  reactions that are happening, I don't really pay too much attention to, but I did want to ask that just because I know it's relevant to other people who may be listening on ATP production. But knowing that we are electromagnetic bodies of water.
Chunk 108/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  point. It's pretty likely that our cells are comprised of this, what you could call coherent water, fourth phase water, right? Yes. And all the chemical
Chunk 107/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  to account everything and really have powerful results. And we had some of our super happy about it. What's incredible to me is thinking about how for Gerald Paulic and Gilbert Ling's work, and I'd throw the work of you guys in there too, at this point.
Chunk 106/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  brainwave study, we're talking about two individuals. It's done properly, so we're in a golden standard study, a genetically identical twins, but with ATP, we really wanted to have a much larger pool. So we really can kind of take into
Chunk 105/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  Like from him and then switched you hadn't done that study. Okay. I know why I thought you had a non- ATP study was a complete different thing. We wanted to have much larger Kind of pool of people because with this
Chunk 104/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  Incredible. Incredible. How did you study as well on genetically identical twins with ATP production where you gave one twin the water and measured ATP in his
Chunk 103/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  correlation between ATP and NAD and we already proved more than significant rise in ATP. We are actually measuring that of line plus super control study rise in NAD levels. So this is also something that we are super excited.
Chunk 102/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  in a couple of months where we're actually measuring NAD levels. In the whole biohacking and health awareness circles, everybody knows about why and how it's important to keep elevated NAD levels. Since there is a great
Chunk 101/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  just within two months of drinking and animal water, your mitochondrial function increases more than significant. Incredible. We are actually doing now double blind placebo controlled study. It's going to be finished pretty soon.
Chunk 100/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  or something like that, we're talking about actual mitochondrial energy. All scientists, now, most scientists now agree that one of the key causes of cellular aging is the decline in mitochondrial function. And we actually proved the
Chunk 99/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  percent rise in overall mitochondrial energy of the body over the placebo. So when it calculates the placebo and that's almost one third of entire mitochondrial energy, we're not talking about here red-blue energy.
Chunk 98/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  of an animal water per day without any change in their diets, exercise room, everything else stayed the same. And after two months, we did another test to see what happened. And what we saw was 20% of the population of the animal.
Chunk 97/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  accurately measure ATP levels in humans. So this is the method that we employed. So we did a quote and quote snapshot of ATP levels in the beginning of study in all of the participants. Then they drank a liter and a half
Chunk 96/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  to happen to people's ATP levels when they drink and lm water. So we employed loose phrase, which is an enzyme that catalyzed light production in bioluminescent organisms and due to its extraordinary sensitivity, you can very accurately
Chunk 95/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  So all of our cellular mitochondrial energy goes just to feed the brain. So people with higher ATP levels have higher cognitive performance. This has been already well established. Anyhow, we wanted to do a double blind placebo control study to see what's going
Chunk 94/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  of cellular processes in our body, including muscle contraction, nerve impulse transmission, biochemical reactions, every heartbeat, every breath depends on ATP. I mean, the biggest spender of ATP is actually the brain.
Chunk 93/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  And scientifically accepted way to measure cellular energy in humans. So we came to ATP, a denizen triphosphate, the primary energy currency of the cell, directly responsible for powering the majority of the cells.
Chunk 92/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  Currently, since the reason at the moment, a device that can measure bio photon emissions in a very accurate way with humans, we wanted to see, okay, what's the most accurate
Chunk 91/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  really interesting since we measured consistently every single time when we when we did these bio photon emissions on plants, we realized that cellular activity cellular energy increases more than significant.

Chunk 45/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  How can we describe the water that is inside of this one? There are very, very, very few places on the planet where you can actually find water in that particular state. And as soon as you take the water out, water might be a little bit more.

Chunk 30/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  We realized that when you water plants with coherent water with an LEMO water, we saw between 60 and 200 percent increase in biofault and emissions. So the vitality of the LEMO is that the LEMO is a very important part of the LEMO.
Chunk 29/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  re-biological system exudes. The more biophotons of biological system exudes more vitality it has. So we actually had a huge green house in the Netherlands where we played with plants. And,
Chunk 28/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  living thing. So very early on they saw that when you change the water, everything else changed. With this bio photon technology, bio photons are these tiny particles of light that every
Chunk 27/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  over 50 plus scientists or three continents and many millions of dollars invested in this incredible thing which really has incredible power to change biology again of basically every
Chunk 26/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  the mental thing. And very early, they actually picked up a whole lab of a famous German scientist, Dr. Fritz Elbert Pop, who developed this bio-photan technology. And all of the scientists just so you know this is now 15 years in research.
Chunk 25/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  even more than that. And they, for the lack of the better word, they wanted to find the secret to life. They wanted to see what moves life, so to speak. What is the most fun
Chunk 24/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  super happy and grateful to be a part of the whole thing. So where it all started. It's actually very interesting. Doves Anting and Dr. Eklarker, they came together many years ago now. It's like 15 years ago or more.
Chunk 23/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  We tested it on humans, we tested it on humans, animals, plants, and we actually found incredible impact on the environment as well, which we are going to go in all of these details.
Chunk 22/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  then you just want to do it justice. As me, I'm the CEO of Anon Water, and I just want to do whatever is in my power to bring this to as much people as possible so that people can get the benefit. We actually tested it on plant-based plants.
Chunk 21/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  companies about is really bringing when we realized that water is the most fundamental level of our existence and when you change that entire biology of basically anything changes.
Chunk 20/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  Thank you so much for having me really named several people which I'm a huge fan of so I'm just super super happy and super grateful to be part of this project and what are all for entire

Chunk 18/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  I were blown away by your products and what you guys have done with the animal one and some other products you're creating and i'm good friends with Luke story and he is raving about all that you guys do so. That's why i'm here having this conversation again.
Chunk 17/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  But after speaking with you guys last two and a halfish years ago, it really, really, really blew me away. And then two people that I trust quite a bit, Dr. Andy Kaufman and Dr. Tom Cowan.
Chunk 16/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  health. But so when I was first sent to Anna Limowand, I was extremely skeptical because it's like, what is this little lightsaber looking thing that I'm holding and what is this doing with my water?
Chunk 15/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  with use, extruding forks and then maybe a couple of other things. But generally, I like to call myself a natural health maximalist just to where, you know, using sunlight breath movement, feeling my feelings and putting my feet on the earth and things like this to maintain my
Chunk 14/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  I almost feel like I should have mine with me just to show that I do, but I do twirl my anilimewand at least 40 seconds every time I pour a glass of water and I use my aqua cure a little bit. I use my bio charger a little bit. I lean
Chunk 13/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  Two years, a little more than two years, I think since I spoke to you last. And I've said this a number of times on the show, I'm not a huge product sky. There is a few products that I use consistently. And.

Chunk 186/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  Yeah, I'm always open to any ideas because we can only do so much studies at a time, but we know that it's so fast that we can go in various directions. So please, well, it would be cool to take. Okay. So let me back up. So,
Chunk 185/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  body so that it functions in its optimum way. What would be another cool study to do? My mind's going off. Please, please, please. I mean, I can't just know we're going in so many ways. I'm taking it.
Chunk 184/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  any lesser frequency just goes out of the door. Water takes up this dominant frequency and when you drink that water, you're actually introducing what's relevant and natural and appropriate to your
Chunk 183/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  thing, but the key element is the actual vibration over the water. And this is where the lemma comes in. This is what an dilemma does. It just changes because water always picks up the most dominant frequency of the environment.
Chunk 182/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  this mix of sort of chaotic, polarizing energy because it has imprints of both the bad and the good left over in it. So it's just in a frenetic state, I'd imagine. Agreed. So when you purify the water, you are doing a good,
Chunk 181/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  toxins and things like this, but you're also putting it through right angles and things like this. So it's not going to be in its coherent state. It's just stripped of both both all the things that are bad, all the bad things have happened to it and all the good things, but then has
Chunk 180/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  and still remains in the water. And even so, if you're using reverse osmosis or distillation of some kind, you are still denaturing the water, stripping water of its essence in a way you could say, yes, you're stripping it of all the bad parts.
Chunk 179/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  of that toxin. Vibrational information with that toxin is still inside the water. That's a really good point. And that's like a reverse, I would say, antagonist of homiopathy, you could say where it's like the bad things, the bad energy of that toxin.
Chunk 178/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  to the chemical side of things, maybe this is a perfect opportunity to touch upon that. And like, let's kind of purify the water. Yeah. And that's totally important to get me wrong. But if you take, even if you take the toxin out, the information,
Chunk 177/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  the only change. Water is at the very heart of it. Water absorbs it. Water receives it. Water transmits it. Again, that's why it's so important how we treat our water. Usually people always go
Chunk 176/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  everything is the same. Had visual signs of decay and it had a foul smell. So water picks up the most dominant frequency of its environment. That's
Chunk 175/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  And after a week or so, the rice that had beautiful emotion expressed through it had the beautiful fermented smell of rice and you could even after a week eat that rice. Well, the other one, so it's the same rice every day.
Chunk 174/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  one cup and expressed all the most beautiful emotions in his heart. Gratitude, love, joy, acceptance, all the beautiful emotions. And to the other one, he came every single day and he expressed all the negative emotions.
Chunk 173/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  and I invite your listeners to do it themselves. What he did, he took rice and he boiled it. So water entered into it and he separated into two cups and every single day he came to
Chunk 172/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  living breathing thing. It's extraordinarily intelligent. That's why I love the work of Dr. Masaru Emoto. He actually proved that he invited thousands of people and thousands and thousands of people kind of did this experience for them.
Chunk 171/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  realize that water changes electrometrically every single day due to position of the earth towards the sun. Wow, okay. So you're not going to see static frequency. That makes sense. Water result.
Chunk 170/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  So, an alema is actually a power symbol of the sun. We realized, for instance, if you take a photo of the sun from the same place of the Earth for 365 days, in a year, you will get this infinity sign on the sky.
Chunk 169/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  have you guys done anything to measure the actual frequency? Because I know the background resident frequency of the Earth is 7.83 Hertz. Have you guys measured the frequency of the water? This is actually very interesting. Why we called it an M.
Chunk 168/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  essentially sink up with the earth, then it would be doing the same thing with us, syncing us back up with nature as we should be. One question that I had related to the water itself is
Chunk 167/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  experience shifts and you start to experience connection with life. I mean, it totally makes sense because if what the water is doing is helping the seeds to
Chunk 166/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  I mean, they start to change their diets, they start to change how they behave because something fundamental changes. This water is a life affirming. That's why people who are meditators start to...
Chunk 165/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  you're connected to something which is vast beyond imagination. That's why people when they start drinking and I'm worried they start to have these very connected experiences, they start to change their life.
Chunk 164/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  Then something much larger than you can not only operate through you, but you can have a larger experience of life in yourself.
Chunk 163/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  You are either part of that and vibrating with it in a powerful way or you're actually separate from it. When you are part of it, you are part of life.
Chunk 162/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  in harmony or in resonance with planet Earth and even larger electromagnetic environment, because planet Earth is also part of something much larger. So you
Chunk 161/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  you go back all crystal radios in the very beginning, back in a day, with crystal based. So your entire body is a crystal, so to speak. And then you're either
Chunk 160/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  So this is also very interesting. Since 99% of our body are molecules of water, we are actually an antenna because when
Chunk 159/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  Amazing health effects. It's really amazing. No question there. But what we are talking about this. This is what it's all about. Yeah. It's bringing it's bringing life into a state of connection. Yeah.
Chunk 158/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  earth. So then it's naturally synced up with all the happenings of the earth and nature, which is that that that alone right there is mind blowing. Like I'm saying, this is the core of it. Everything else is kind of awesome.
Chunk 157/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  the mission of light that is coming off of these seeds because you're treating it with the coherent water, which again is water that is coming back to the state that water should be in on the
Chunk 156/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  Yeah, that's the implications of that are so mind blowing. Yeah, that's incredible. So I'm interested to know based on that, if this is sinking the

No more bills, fresh clean water right out of the ground or
Chunk 153/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  and why we want it, but few have cracked the code on how to achieve it. Our friend Jonathan England has cracked the code on the how. On August 3rd, he is hosting the Off-Grid Dream Life event where he'll show you the four steps to transform your vision.
Chunk 152/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  sourcing clean spring-fed water together. And with modern society headed towards the cliff of tyranny and the centralization of power, it's important to consider life where we can thrive irrespective of what happens with the rest of society. Most of us know what we want,
Chunk 151/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  you probably look out at the state of the world and think, I know there is a much better way of doing things.

Chunk 146/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  and a deep understanding of the true nature of health and disease sets this clinic apart. With the new biology clinic, it's not about quick fixes and suppressing symptoms. The practitioners take time to understand your unique story, recognizing that health is unique to the
Chunk 145/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  invasive treatments with unpleasant side effects. If this sounds all too familiar, consider a different approach with the new biology clinic founded by Dr. Tom Cowan, or respected natural health doctor, author, and speaker. Dr. Cowan's holistic perspective on health and wellness
Chunk 144/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  with modern health systems, you're waiting months for appointments only to spend a mere 10 minutes with a doctor who quickly hands out a generic diagnosis that is likely rooted in a total misunderstanding of health and causes. Then you're offered a one size fits all medication or an

Chunk 141/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  to move with the earth. We are part of this planet. We are not some separate beings living in kind of, no, we are part of this incredible being called the earth. We are part of it. The same
Chunk 140/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  I think that we're even though things look crazy on the outside, I really believe that we're moving in a beautiful direction. And you want to be moving electromagnetically with it. You want
Chunk 139/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  you're moving with it. And that makes the whole difference in the world. So this is the core of Anilema. This is what it does. There is a huge change happening on this planet. Planet is moving forward. I
Chunk 138/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  you in a powerful way to your relevant electromagnetic environment. This is what we need now in this point in time. You move with the Earth and not separate from it.
Chunk 137/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  This is what it does to us. When you drink in a lemon water, you are, you know how in this day and age, we're disconnected from ourselves and disconnected from basically everything, people, everything. This connects
Chunk 136/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  of life to the circadian rhythm of nature. It connected the seed, electromagnetic, it tweets a larger, relevant environment. And this
Chunk 135/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  And we couldn't figure it out, we connected to other scientists and after a while we realized that it started to follow the tide. So an animal water connected this tiny piece of water.
Chunk 134/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  It was weird. You just sprinkled a couple of drops of anolema water and you started seeing this happening. It's like the seeds started to breathe a light in a very long, long way. And
Chunk 133/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  regular water within the sea nothing special. But almost as soon as we started watering seeds with anilemo water, we started seeing this sinusoidal shape of peaks and valleys of biofault and emissions. Why?
Chunk 132/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  and we took seeds, it's tiny pieces of life. I mean like it cannot be more simple than that. And we watered some with regular water and some with an LMO water. And we monitored bio-photony missions. And seeds that were watered with
Chunk 131/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  effects on helping us. But I'm going to touch upon now what we feel it's all about. So anyhow, early on, we were doing research on these biophoton emissions.
Chunk 130/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  So I'm going to mention this study that we did, which is really, really, really extraordinary and really kind of showcases. To be honest, this is what it's all about. All of these other studies, which definitively prove powerful.
Chunk 129/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  to witness all of this, you have a responsibility to do the very best that you can to bring this information into the world in the pureest possible way.
Chunk 128/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  My whole thing is just to do the whole project just this because when you witness, and I'm going to come into some really crazy, I'm going to mention this study which really kind of blew our minds.
Chunk 127/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  the very same thing. Beautiful. So well said. So well said. I mean, you're, uh, you've got to be a perfect steward of water if you're communicating on behalf of this product. So it makes, it makes sense that you're.
Chunk 126/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  powerful and very tangible way. What will pick it up and what will store it? That's why it's so important how we treat water and since 99% of our molecules of water, how we treat each other is
Chunk 125/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  I'm literally changing their biology. When you understand that, you cannot behave in the same way. You just cannot. Because you know that you are impacting another human being. You know.
Chunk 124/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  show up with people has a powerful quantum and actually very real effect on the biology of a human being. So if I'm sending kindness, if I'm sending love to people,
Chunk 123/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  And what always picks up the most dominant frequency of the environment and it stores it. When you become aware of that, you know that you how you show up in the world, how you show up in the world, how you show up in the world.
Chunk 122/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  Everything happens through it. That's why it's so important. You know, it's totally cool to me how water teaches us to be kind. Because we are 99% water.
Chunk 121/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  And water being the absorber receiver and transmitter of energy frequency and vibration, it's at the very heart of our biology.
Chunk 120/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  The greatest scientist of all time, at least in my eye, Nikola Tesla, he said, like, if you want to know the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy frequency and vibrancy.
Chunk 119/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  the week in coherent chaotic water to help bring it into coherence as you're stirring it with the one. We've said it perfectly. So thank you so much for that. It's exactly the way it is. And you know,
Chunk 118/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  a strong coherent water and it has a strong coherent field since it is so, let's say, electrically charged. It's probably not the correct term, but it itself has a strong coherent field that is then overtaking an entrant.
Chunk 117/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  have to say. So Eileen McEusek said says a strong coherent field will always overtake and entrain a weak and coherent field. So I'd imagine the water inside of this quartz encasing is
Chunk 116/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  So it's transmitting its harmonious energy into the water that you're stirring and then you then consume that and you're consuming more coherent water. And I've said this quote like a thousand times in recent episodes, but it's always so relevant.
Chunk 115/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  So basically the water inside of this animal wand is we could say teaching the water that you stir it with via this quartz encase.
Chunk 114/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  possible way that there could be something physically transmitted between the two cultures just to quartz encasing between the two. One culture was able to transmit information to the other cultures. So quartz, as we know, like you said, is a superconductor. Yes. So
Chunk 113/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  from the 1970s and 80s, where they would manipulate some things in a cell culture. And then there was a quartz pain in between two different cell cultures, essentially, only manipulating one of them with no
Chunk 112/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  is coherent water encased in a quartz encasing, right? And quartz acts as a super conductor. Super conductor, right? So, and then that's why they use cell phones and things like this, and there's some interesting studies in Russia.
Chunk 111/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  are to function properly. So I think it makes total sense what you've got here. So let me, let me see if I can summarize the sort of mechanism of action as best I can for the audience and layman's terms. So what we have here.
Chunk 110/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  and that we are comprised likely a fourth phase water. It would make sense that we would want to introduce more coherent water and that we would want to drink coherent water in order for the bodies of water that we would want to drink.
Chunk 109/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  reactions that are happening, I don't really pay too much attention to, but I did want to ask that just because I know it's relevant to other people who may be listening on ATP production. But knowing that we are electromagnetic bodies of water.
Chunk 108/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  point. It's pretty likely that our cells are comprised of this, what you could call coherent water, fourth phase water, right? Yes. And all the chemical
Chunk 107/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  to account everything and really have powerful results. And we had some of our super happy about it. What's incredible to me is thinking about how for Gerald Paulic and Gilbert Ling's work, and I'd throw the work of you guys in there too, at this point.
Chunk 106/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  brainwave study, we're talking about two individuals. It's done properly, so we're in a golden standard study, a genetically identical twins, but with ATP, we really wanted to have a much larger pool. So we really can kind of take into
Chunk 105/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  Like from him and then switched you hadn't done that study. Okay. I know why I thought you had a non- ATP study was a complete different thing. We wanted to have much larger Kind of pool of people because with this

Chunk 104/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  Incredible. Incredible. How did you study as well on genetically identical twins with ATP production where you gave one twin the water and measured ATP in his
Chunk 103/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  correlation between ATP and NAD and we already proved more than significant rise in ATP. We are actually measuring that of line plus super control study rise in NAD levels. So this is also something that we are super excited.
Chunk 102/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  in a couple of months where we're actually measuring NAD levels. In the whole biohacking and health awareness circles, everybody knows about why and how it's important to keep elevated NAD levels. Since there is a great
Chunk 101/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  just within two months of drinking and animal water, your mitochondrial function increases more than significant. Incredible. We are actually doing now double blind placebo controlled study. It's going to be finished pretty soon.
Chunk 100/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  or something like that, we're talking about actual mitochondrial energy. All scientists, now, most scientists now agree that one of the key causes of cellular aging is the decline in mitochondrial function. And we actually proved the
Chunk 99/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  percent rise in overall mitochondrial energy of the body over the placebo. So when it calculates the placebo and that's almost one third of entire mitochondrial energy, we're not talking about here red-blue energy.
Chunk 98/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  of an animal water per day without any change in their diets, exercise room, everything else stayed the same. And after two months, we did another test to see what happened. And what we saw was 20% of the population of the animal.
Chunk 97/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  accurately measure ATP levels in humans. So this is the method that we employed. So we did a quote and quote snapshot of ATP levels in the beginning of study in all of the participants. Then they drank a liter and a half
Chunk 96/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  to happen to people's ATP levels when they drink and lm water. So we employed loose phrase, which is an enzyme that catalyzed light production in bioluminescent organisms and due to its extraordinary sensitivity, you can very accurately
Chunk 95/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  So all of our cellular mitochondrial energy goes just to feed the brain. So people with higher ATP levels have higher cognitive performance. This has been already well established. Anyhow, we wanted to do a double blind placebo control study to see what's going
Chunk 94/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  of cellular processes in our body, including muscle contraction, nerve impulse transmission, biochemical reactions, every heartbeat, every breath depends on ATP. I mean, the biggest spender of ATP is actually the brain.
Chunk 93/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  And scientifically accepted way to measure cellular energy in humans. So we came to ATP, a denizen triphosphate, the primary energy currency of the cell, directly responsible for powering the majority of the cells.
Chunk 92/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  Currently, since the reason at the moment, a device that can measure bio photon emissions in a very accurate way with humans, we wanted to see, okay, what's the most accurate
Chunk 91/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  really interesting since we measured consistently every single time when we when we did these bio photon emissions on plants, we realized that cellular activity cellular energy increases more than significant.
Chunk 90/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  few instances where we didn't see this powerful effect. So it's really, it's really remarkable. Incredible. Can we talk about the ATP studies a little bit? Yes. So this is actually where it was
Chunk 89/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  So we want to do it justice. So we want to do it the right way. And of course we want to know what the effect is and this is the only way to do it. But I'm telling you in so many years of research that we're very very very...
Chunk 88/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  by the book. At the very end of the study, when all the data is out, then we are actually opening the box and then you see who's what and then you do the math on it. And always we're using third party independent research organizations.
Chunk 87/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  effect. Exactly. It's very clear because you control it for everything else. Yes. And not only that, we did after that double blind placebo controlled ATP study on many more subjects. And we did double blind placebo control microbiome. So we're doing everything.
Chunk 86/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  but one was treated with the Annelema wand. And the other one wasn't. Yeah. Right. That's the only. That's the only change. So in here, the independent variable is, I guess you could say the wand itself, seeing if it had a
Chunk 85/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  gratifying thing to observe and to witness and then be a part of the whole process. Wow. Incredible. So with this water in this study, was it that you had the same source of water, same type of water.
Chunk 84/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  And then we kind of decided to do the second study, the third study, and did the whole thing. And that's how we came here. There are so many moments in our research where we were like, what happened here? Which is really extraordinarily great.
Chunk 83/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  While the first one now, they took a couple of sips of regular water, there was nothing. So this was really kind of, it was really mind-blowing for us. Again, it just reaffirmed there is something extraordinary happening here.
Chunk 82/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  remarkable happens here. Then three weeks later we repeated the experiment and we gave an alarm alert to the other twin. And since they are genetically identical, we saw exactly the same phenomenon, exactly the same change.
Chunk 81/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  instant a better connection between the left and the right hemisphere of the brain and instant harmonizing effect on the brain waves. The change was very palpable. This was first and very powerful and irrefutable evidence that something biological
Chunk 80/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  their brainwave patterns, everything basically stayed the same. But almost as soon as when the twin took a couple of sips of an Alamoor, we were actually super surprised with how fast it happened. There was an instant almost in.
Chunk 79/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  And twins didn't know which one was which. They just took a couple of sips of water and we monitored their brain waves to see whether something would happen. So as the twin that took a couple of sips of regular water, there was no change. So
Chunk 78/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  where we invited two genetically identical twins, it's a golden standard study, and we actually put QEG equipment on their heads and remodeling their brainwaves. So the doctor administering the water didn't know which one was which.
Chunk 77/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  We can very accurately measure. It's our brainwaves. It's actually very, you can very accurately measure if something happens there and how much it happens and all of the details. So we actually decided to do a GoldenStandard study.
Chunk 76/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  Maybe this is a good moment to jump in our first human study. Since this water is an electromagnetic phenomenon, we were thinking what is the most electromagnetic part of human biology that we
Chunk 75/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  So, since water always picks up the most dominant frequency of its environment, when you drink the glass of mother water, the entire water in your body and you're basically water, starts to change dramatically.
Chunk 74/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  water. But from the molecular side of things, 99% of our molecules are water. We're actually more water than the ocean, if you can imagine. We're basically very clever H2O.
Chunk 73/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  After 40 seconds of swirling, you get a glass of mother water. And when you drink that water, since again, we haven't touched, which is extraordinary, when you look at it, 70% of our body mass is water.

Chunk 65/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  So what is it? What is unique about your product this little, this little stick, this little one that I'm holding that makes it so incredible. Cause I mean, again, what you said last time has blown me away. And I already know you're going to blow me away this time.
Chunk 64/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  said with other examples of coherent water, the moment that you take them out of their original context, they sort of come back into this unstable, disharmonious state you can say.
Chunk 63/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  on it. Yeah, incredible. Very well said. So what is unique about your product in that the water inside of it maintains its coherence through time because as you see,
Chunk 62/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  these days because we're having all of these crazy climate changes and we need plans that are going to resist all of these happenings and can still produce food for us because we are dependent.

Chunk 84/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  And then we kind of decided to do the second study, the third study, and did the whole thing. And that's how we came here. There are so many moments in our research where we were like, what happened here? Which is really extraordinarily great.

Chunk 77/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  We can very accurately measure. It's our brainwaves. It's actually very, you can very accurately measure if something happens there and how much it happens and all of the details. So we actually decided to do a GoldenStandard study.

Chunk 73/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  After 40 seconds of swirling, you get a glass of mother water. And when you drink that water, since again, we haven't touched, which is extraordinary, when you look at it, 70% of our body mass is water.

Chunk 3/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  for health and the nature of reality. In this episode, we discussed both, and it blew me away. We discussed the science behind this little thing right here, this product as well as the other products that they have, and the beautiful implications for our health.

Chunk 58/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  persist, it just remains in this highly, highly structured state. And that's why, you know, we did, we saw this amazing effect on, on basically every living thing. I mean, this latest plan study that we did.
Chunk 57/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  rodent narrowly stable of the just one treatment it just persists and we did many things to it we did things that usually turn water into deeper chaos but for some extraordinary reason this water
Chunk 56/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  We now did like for six consecutive years now we're doing every single year we're doing a new test of water that was treated just once. So after six years it never went out of the state of coherence. So it's extremely
Chunk 55/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  after a very short period of time, what a molecule was break and they go back to chaos. So it was necessary to create stable coherent water because this is where an dilemma really, really, really shines. We are now going to go back to the point where we're going
Chunk 54/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  So it's kind of very not practical and hardly doable and not even that as I mentioned, even if you do a bottling plant, they are water bottling plant and you take it to people. Again, as soon as you take it out, it
Chunk 53/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  a source of water, stream or well of water, within very short kind of walk, it's just not possible to get to even to find that you really have to go remotely somewhere in the jungle.
Chunk 52/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  He offered back to people so that everyone would actually experience the effects of it, the way nature intended. So it's very hard to find that and if people find that kind of...
Chunk 51/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  all, like you mentioned, modernization with all the negative effects with it, that balance, that harmony got actually destroyed. So something was necessary to bring it back and to be
Chunk 50/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  Usually, you know, when you have a free-flowing water, it has this left and right vortexes, which actually keep water in this particular natural state. But due to everything that has been happening, the whole world.
Chunk 49/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  non-native electromagnetic fields and toxins in our environment and things like this, even most rivers and bodies of water that would have previously been in a coherent state are no longer in a coherent state. Exactly. Exactly.
Chunk 48/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  about the coherent water so you were saying that Mother Earth is the hidden voice behind this whole project and is is that mean that because of let's say modernization and
Chunk 47/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  because the EMFs really put water into chaotic state. It really kind of depends the whole effect. But sorry, lost my chain of thought. Well, no, it's okay. We are talking about
Chunk 46/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  molecules break and the water goes back to chaos. So to be honest, we feel that Mother Earth is the hidden voice of this whole project because it was necessary due to toxins, EMFs, all kinds of things we can talk about EMFs as well.
Chunk 45/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  How can we describe the water that is inside of this one? There are very, very, very few places on the planet where you can actually find water in that particular state. And as soon as you take the water out, water might be a little bit more.
Chunk 44/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  a few different types of sleeves that you can put it in. But so when we say coherent water, are we talking about actual mimicry, if you will, of water in a stream or how...
Chunk 43/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  or on the Jedi side because it's not green or red, but it's just clear water. I think it's encapsulated in a quartz encasing, correct me if I'm wrong. Yes. Yeah, with a little metal bottom, so it literally does look like a lightsaber and it comes in.
Chunk 42/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  Could we say that the coherent water that is in this wand my wife actually brought it to me. So this is what it looks like for the people that are on video for the people that are not on video it looks like a clear lightsaber. So I don't know if it's on the sits.
Chunk 41/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  much much much bigger impact and power. The same thing is with water. Incredible. Incredible. So when you mentioned that this is water as nature or as God intended it to be
Chunk 40/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  take five of what laser. So laser of the same power, which is a coherent form of light, you can drill a hole through your table. So the power is the same. But when light enters into coherent state, it has...
Chunk 39/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  are truly extraordinary. To explain the concept of people, again, in maybe a way people can understand, is like if you take a five watt light bulb, it will give you some light. But if you take a five watt bulb,
Chunk 38/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  in only two months. So with just watering the soil with an LM water, that piece of soil became fertile again. We are also going to go into that study in a little while, but effects of it are
Chunk 37/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  with plants. We actually treated this is also fascinating. We actually took completely dead piece of soil destroyed by glyphoseneral other toxins. It's barren. You couldn't grow anything on it. And we revived it completely.
Chunk 36/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  So when you drink this water, there is incredible effect. Short-term and long-term, and we did both, and we're going to jump into the science with a double-blind placebo control studies where we prove this. The same thing happens when we're in the lab.
Chunk 35/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  And through this unique process, when this happens, the true power of water is being unleashed. The true effect, the way we see it is how nature intended the water to be in the first place.
Chunk 34/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  exist in what we call a full spectrum coherent state where those same astromylic hills they link together they start to move in unison they start to they enter into harmony so this
Chunk 33/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  So it's still H2O, but those H2O molecules are moving randomly, they're actually crashing into each other constantly, but since all of this is happening on an atomic level nobody's really aware of that. We found that water can exist in the water.

Chunk 14/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  I almost feel like I should have mine with me just to show that I do, but I do twirl my anilimewand at least 40 seconds every time I pour a glass of water and I use my aqua cure a little bit. I use my bio charger a little bit. I lean
Chunk 13/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  Two years, a little more than two years, I think since I spoke to you last. And I've said this a number of times on the show, I'm not a huge product sky. There is a few products that I use consistently. And.

Chunk 7/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  so many ways and it has so many incredible implications for the future that just, yeah, you'll have to see for yourself or hear for yourself. It's an incredible conversation. So if you're interested in sharing,
Chunk 6/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  I've talked to Mario before, but this episode blew me away. Truly what they're doing at Annelema is totally paradigm shifting and so on.
Chunk 5/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  anytime I make a glass of water at home and I genuinely mean that I use this literally anytime I make a glass of water at home. I use this during my water fast and I discussed the results of my water fast in episode 75 if you're interested. But I would
Chunk 4/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  the health of our soil, our food and really for the entire earth. This little thing is a game changer. I mean that. It's one of those episodes where I say wow like 100 times. I use this in
Chunk 3/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  for health and the nature of reality. In this episode, we discussed both, and it blew me away. We discussed the science behind this little thing right here, this product as well as the other products that they have, and the beautiful implications for our health.
Chunk 2/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  a quartz crystal encasing and inside of the encasing is stable coherent water. And like a lightsaber, this thing is incredibly powerful. I geek out anytime I get a chance to discuss water, it's implicated.

Chunk 56/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  We now did like for six consecutive years now we're doing every single year we're doing a new test of water that was treated just once. So after six years it never went out of the state of coherence. So it's extremely
Chunk 55/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  after a very short period of time, what a molecule was break and they go back to chaos. So it was necessary to create stable coherent water because this is where an dilemma really, really, really shines. We are now going to go back to the point where we're going
Chunk 54/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  So it's kind of very not practical and hardly doable and not even that as I mentioned, even if you do a bottling plant, they are water bottling plant and you take it to people. Again, as soon as you take it out, it
Chunk 53/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  a source of water, stream or well of water, within very short kind of walk, it's just not possible to get to even to find that you really have to go remotely somewhere in the jungle.
Chunk 52/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  He offered back to people so that everyone would actually experience the effects of it, the way nature intended. So it's very hard to find that and if people find that kind of...
Chunk 51/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  all, like you mentioned, modernization with all the negative effects with it, that balance, that harmony got actually destroyed. So something was necessary to bring it back and to be
Chunk 50/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  Usually, you know, when you have a free-flowing water, it has this left and right vortexes, which actually keep water in this particular natural state. But due to everything that has been happening, the whole world.
Chunk 49/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  non-native electromagnetic fields and toxins in our environment and things like this, even most rivers and bodies of water that would have previously been in a coherent state are no longer in a coherent state. Exactly. Exactly.
Chunk 48/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  about the coherent water so you were saying that Mother Earth is the hidden voice behind this whole project and is is that mean that because of let's say modernization and
Chunk 47/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  because the EMFs really put water into chaotic state. It really kind of depends the whole effect. But sorry, lost my chain of thought. Well, no, it's okay. We are talking about
Chunk 46/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  molecules break and the water goes back to chaos. So to be honest, we feel that Mother Earth is the hidden voice of this whole project because it was necessary due to toxins, EMFs, all kinds of things we can talk about EMFs as well.
Chunk 45/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  How can we describe the water that is inside of this one? There are very, very, very few places on the planet where you can actually find water in that particular state. And as soon as you take the water out, water might be a little bit more.
Chunk 44/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  a few different types of sleeves that you can put it in. But so when we say coherent water, are we talking about actual mimicry, if you will, of water in a stream or how...
Chunk 43/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  or on the Jedi side because it's not green or red, but it's just clear water. I think it's encapsulated in a quartz encasing, correct me if I'm wrong. Yes. Yeah, with a little metal bottom, so it literally does look like a lightsaber and it comes in.
Chunk 42/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  Could we say that the coherent water that is in this wand my wife actually brought it to me. So this is what it looks like for the people that are on video for the people that are not on video it looks like a clear lightsaber. So I don't know if it's on the sits.
Chunk 41/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  much much much bigger impact and power. The same thing is with water. Incredible. Incredible. So when you mentioned that this is water as nature or as God intended it to be
Chunk 40/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  take five of what laser. So laser of the same power, which is a coherent form of light, you can drill a hole through your table. So the power is the same. But when light enters into coherent state, it has...
Chunk 39/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  are truly extraordinary. To explain the concept of people, again, in maybe a way people can understand, is like if you take a five watt light bulb, it will give you some light. But if you take a five watt bulb,
Chunk 38/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  in only two months. So with just watering the soil with an LM water, that piece of soil became fertile again. We are also going to go into that study in a little while, but effects of it are
Chunk 37/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  with plants. We actually treated this is also fascinating. We actually took completely dead piece of soil destroyed by glyphoseneral other toxins. It's barren. You couldn't grow anything on it. And we revived it completely.
Chunk 36/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  So when you drink this water, there is incredible effect. Short-term and long-term, and we did both, and we're going to jump into the science with a double-blind placebo control studies where we prove this. The same thing happens when we're in the lab.
Chunk 35/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  And through this unique process, when this happens, the true power of water is being unleashed. The true effect, the way we see it is how nature intended the water to be in the first place.
Chunk 34/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  exist in what we call a full spectrum coherent state where those same astromylic hills they link together they start to move in unison they start to they enter into harmony so this
Chunk 33/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  So it's still H2O, but those H2O molecules are moving randomly, they're actually crashing into each other constantly, but since all of this is happening on an atomic level nobody's really aware of that. We found that water can exist in the water.
Chunk 32/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  to make a couple of steps back just to explain the concept of coherent water. We realized in our early research that water currently exists in what we call a chaotic state.
Chunk 31/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  of plants like skyrocket, especially when you compare it to regular water and then watering plants with regular water. So there we realized okay there is something truly special happening here.
Chunk 30/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  We realized that when you water plants with coherent water with an LEMO water, we saw between 60 and 200 percent increase in biofault and emissions. So the vitality of the LEMO is that the LEMO is a very important part of the LEMO.
Chunk 29/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  re-biological system exudes. The more biophotons of biological system exudes more vitality it has. So we actually had a huge green house in the Netherlands where we played with plants. And,
Chunk 28/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  living thing. So very early on they saw that when you change the water, everything else changed. With this bio photon technology, bio photons are these tiny particles of light that every
Chunk 27/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  over 50 plus scientists or three continents and many millions of dollars invested in this incredible thing which really has incredible power to change biology again of basically every
Chunk 26/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  the mental thing. And very early, they actually picked up a whole lab of a famous German scientist, Dr. Fritz Elbert Pop, who developed this bio-photan technology. And all of the scientists just so you know this is now 15 years in research.
Chunk 25/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  even more than that. And they, for the lack of the better word, they wanted to find the secret to life. They wanted to see what moves life, so to speak. What is the most fun
Chunk 24/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  super happy and grateful to be a part of the whole thing. So where it all started. It's actually very interesting. Doves Anting and Dr. Eklarker, they came together many years ago now. It's like 15 years ago or more.
Chunk 23/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  We tested it on humans, we tested it on humans, animals, plants, and we actually found incredible impact on the environment as well, which we are going to go in all of these details.
Chunk 22/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  then you just want to do it justice. As me, I'm the CEO of Anon Water, and I just want to do whatever is in my power to bring this to as much people as possible so that people can get the benefit. We actually tested it on plant-based plants.
Chunk 21/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  companies about is really bringing when we realized that water is the most fundamental level of our existence and when you change that entire biology of basically anything changes.
Chunk 20/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  Thank you so much for having me really named several people which I'm a huge fan of so I'm just super super happy and super grateful to be part of this project and what are all for entire
Chunk 19/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  and sort of updating my new audience, all the new people that we have on this incredible product. So let's just start with the very beginning of Annelema and how it came about. First of all, thank you so much for having me.
Chunk 18/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  I were blown away by your products and what you guys have done with the animal one and some other products you're creating and i'm good friends with Luke story and he is raving about all that you guys do so. That's why i'm here having this conversation again.
Chunk 17/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  But after speaking with you guys last two and a halfish years ago, it really, really, really blew me away. And then two people that I trust quite a bit, Dr. Andy Kaufman and Dr. Tom Cowan.
Chunk 16/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  health. But so when I was first sent to Anna Limowand, I was extremely skeptical because it's like, what is this little lightsaber looking thing that I'm holding and what is this doing with my water?
Chunk 15/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  with use, extruding forks and then maybe a couple of other things.

Chunk 6/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  I've talked to Mario before, but this episode blew me away. Truly what they're doing at Annelema is totally paradigm shifting and so on.
Chunk 5/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  anytime I make a glass of water at home and I genuinely mean that I use this literally anytime I make a glass of water at home. I use this during my water fast and I discussed the results of my water fast in episode 75 if you're interested. But I would
Chunk 4/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  the health of our soil, our food and really for the entire earth. This little thing is a game changer. I mean that. It's one of those episodes where I say wow like 100 times. I use this in
Chunk 3/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  for health and the nature of reality. In this episode, we discussed both, and it blew me away. We discussed the science behind this little thing right here, this product as well as the other products that they have, and the beautiful implications for our health.

Chunk 113/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  from the 1970s and 80s, where they would manipulate some things in a cell culture. And then there was a quartz pain in between two different cell cultures, essentially, only manipulating one of them with no
Chunk 112/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  is coherent water encased in a quartz encasing, right? And quartz acts as a super conductor. Super conductor, right? So, and then that's why they use cell phones and things like this, and there's some interesting studies in Russia.
Chunk 111/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  are to function properly. So I think it makes total sense what you've got here. So let me, let me see if I can summarize the sort of mechanism of action as best I can for the audience and layman's terms. So what we have here.
Chunk 110/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  and that we are comprised likely a fourth phase water. It would make sense that we would want to introduce more coherent water and that we would want to drink coherent water in order for the bodies of water that we would want to drink.
Chunk 109/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  reactions that are happening, I don't really pay too much attention to, but I did want to ask that just because I know it's relevant to other people who may be listening on ATP production. But knowing that we are electromagnetic bodies of water.
Chunk 108/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  point. It's pretty likely that our cells are comprised of this, what you could call coherent water, fourth phase water, right? Yes. And all the chemical
Chunk 107/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  to account everything and really have powerful results. And we had some of our super happy about it. What's incredible to me is thinking about how for Gerald Paulic and Gilbert Ling's work, and I'd throw the work of you guys in there too, at this point.
Chunk 106/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  brainwave study, we're talking about two individuals. It's done properly, so we're in a golden standard study, a genetically identical twins, but with ATP, we really wanted to have a much larger pool. So we really can kind of take into
Chunk 105/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  Like from him and then switched you hadn't done that study. Okay. I know why I thought you had a non- ATP study was a complete different thing. We wanted to have much larger Kind of pool of people because with this
Chunk 104/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  Incredible. Incredible. How did you study as well on genetically identical twins with ATP production where you gave one twin the water and measured ATP in his
Chunk 103/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  correlation between ATP and NAD and we already proved more than significant rise in ATP. We are actually measuring that of line plus super control study rise in NAD levels. So this is also something that we are super excited.
Chunk 102/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  in a couple of months where we're actually measuring NAD levels. In the whole biohacking and health awareness circles, everybody knows about why and how it's important to keep elevated NAD levels. Since there is a great
Chunk 101/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  just within two months of drinking and animal water, your mitochondrial function increases more than significant. Incredible. We are actually doing now double blind placebo controlled study. It's going to be finished pretty soon.
Chunk 100/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  or something like that, we're talking about actual mitochondrial energy. All scientists, now, most scientists now agree that one of the key causes of cellular aging is the decline in mitochondrial function. And we actually proved the
Chunk 99/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  percent rise in overall mitochondrial energy of the body over the placebo. So when it calculates the placebo and that's almost one third of entire mitochondrial energy, we're not talking about here red-blue energy.
Chunk 98/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  of an animal water per day without any change in their diets, exercise room, everything else stayed the same. And after two months, we did another test to see what happened. And what we saw was 20% of the population of the animal.
Chunk 97/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  accurately measure ATP levels in humans. So this is the method that we employed. So we did a quote and quote snapshot of ATP levels in the beginning of study in all of the participants. Then they drank a liter and a half
Chunk 96/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  to happen to people's ATP levels when they drink and lm water. So we employed loose phrase, which is an enzyme that catalyzed light production in bioluminescent organisms and due to its extraordinary sensitivity, you can very accurately
Chunk 95/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  So all of our cellular mitochondrial energy goes just to feed the brain. So people with higher ATP levels have higher cognitive performance. This has been already well established. Anyhow, we wanted to do a double blind placebo control study to see what's going
Chunk 94/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  of cellular processes in our body, including muscle contraction, nerve impulse transmission, biochemical reactions, every heartbeat, every breath depends on ATP. I mean, the biggest spender of ATP is actually the brain.
Chunk 93/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  And scientifically accepted way to measure cellular energy in humans. So we came to ATP, a denizen triphosphate, the primary energy currency of the cell, directly responsible for powering the majority of the cells.
Chunk 92/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  Currently, since the reason at the moment, a device that can measure bio photon emissions in a very accurate way with humans, we wanted to see, okay, what's the most accurate
Chunk 91/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  really interesting since we measured consistently every single time when we when we did these bio photon emissions on plants, we realized that cellular activity cellular energy increases more than significant.
Chunk 90/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  few instances where we didn't see this powerful effect. So it's really, it's really remarkable. Incredible. Can we talk about the ATP studies a little bit? Yes. So this is actually where it was
Chunk 89/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  So we want to do it justice. So we want to do it the right way. And of course we want to know what the effect is and this is the only way to do it. But I'm telling you in so many years of research that we're very very very...
Chunk 88/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  by the book. At the very end of the study, when all the data is out, then we are actually opening the box and then you see who's what and then you do the math on it. And always we're using third party independent research organizations.
Chunk 87/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  effect. Exactly. It's very clear because you control it for everything else. Yes. And not only that, we did after that double blind placebo controlled ATP study on many more subjects. And we did double blind placebo control microbiome. So we're doing everything.
Chunk 86/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  but one was treated with the Annelema wand. And the other one wasn't. Yeah. Right. That's the only. That's the only change. So in here, the independent variable is, I guess you could say the wand itself, seeing if it had a
Chunk 85/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  gratifying thing to observe and to witness and then be a part of the whole process. Wow. Incredible. So with this water in this study, was it that you had the same source of water, same type of water.
Chunk 84/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  And then we kind of decided to do the second study, the third study, and did the whole thing. And that's how we came here. There are so many moments in our research where we were like, what happened here? Which is really extraordinarily great.
Chunk 83/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  While the first one now, they took a couple of sips of regular water, there was nothing. So this was really kind of, it was really mind-blowing for us. Again, it just reaffirmed there is something extraordinary happening here.
Chunk 82/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  remarkable happens here. Then three weeks later we repeated the experiment and we gave an alarm alert to the other twin. And since they are genetically identical, we saw exactly the same phenomenon, exactly the same change.
Chunk 81/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  instant a better connection between the left and the right hemisphere of the brain and instant harmonizing effect on the brain waves. The change was very palpable. This was first and very powerful and irrefutable evidence that something biological
Chunk 80/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  their brainwave patterns, everything basically stayed the same. But almost as soon as when the twin took a couple of sips of an Alamoor, we were actually super surprised with how fast it happened. There was an instant almost in.
Chunk 79/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  And twins didn't know which one was which. They just took a couple of sips of water and we monitored their brain waves to see whether something would happen. So as the twin that took a couple of sips of regular water, there was no change. So
Chunk 78/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  where we invited two genetically identical twins, it's a golden standard study, and we actually put QEG equipment on their heads and remodeling their brainwaves. So the doctor administering the water didn't know which one was which.
Chunk 77/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  We can very accurately measure. It's our brainwaves. It's actually very, you can very accurately measure if something happens there and how much it happens and all of the details. So we actually decided to do a GoldenStandard study.
Chunk 76/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  Maybe this is a good moment to jump in our first human study. Since this water is an electromagnetic phenomenon, we were thinking what is the most electromagnetic part of human biology that we
Chunk 75/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  So, since water always picks up the most dominant frequency of its environment, when you drink the glass of mother water, the entire water in your body and you're basically water, starts to change dramatically.
Chunk 74/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  water. But from the molecular side of things, 99% of our molecules are water. We're actually more water than the ocean, if you can imagine. We're basically very clever H2O.
Chunk 73/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  After 40 seconds of swirling, you get a glass of mother water. And when you drink that water, since again, we haven't touched, which is extraordinary, when you look at it, 70% of our body mass is water.
Chunk 72/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  passed through without any loss. So in effect, when you take the Anelama wand and swirl through the water, any H2O molecule that comes into close proximity to the mother water starts to mimic its exact structure. So in an effect,
Chunk 71/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  you mentioned. And crystal oil has two purposes. Of course, one to create the barrier between the mother water and the side and rest of the water. But more importantly, crystal serves as a superconductor. It allows the frequency of mother water to be
Chunk 70/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  That's where we went really deep. And after a lot of research, we found what we are calling now the mother of water. The water in this particular extraordinary state, and we actually put it in a crystal bile just like a crystal.
Chunk 69/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  do that, we knew that if we would expose any other water to it, since water always picks up the most dominant frequency of its environment, all the water would become exactly like it.
Chunk 68/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  there. So anyhow, when we realize that water always picks up the most dominant frequency of its environment, our whole goal was to create the most positive dominant frequency water there is. Because if we managed
Chunk 67/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  important how we treat our water. That's why it's so important how it's why it's so important where we keep our water. And you can imagine where the municipal water goes until it reaches our tap and what kind of frequencies are induced.
Chunk 66/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  and blow away the audience. So what makes this unique? So since we realized early on in the research that water always picks up the most dominant frequency of its environment, always. So that's why it's so important.
Chunk 65/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  So what is it? What is unique about your product this little, this little stick, this little one that I'm holding that makes it so incredible. Cause I mean, again, what you said last time has blown me away. And I already know you're going to blow me away this time.
Chunk 64/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  said with other examples of coherent water, the moment that you take them out of their original context, they sort of come back into this unstable, disharmonious state you can say.
Chunk 63/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  on it. Yeah, incredible. Very well said. So what is unique about your product in that the water inside of it maintains its coherence through time because as you see,
Chunk 62/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  these days because we're having all of these crazy climate changes and we need plans that are going to resist all of these happenings and can still produce food for us because we are dependent.
Chunk 61/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  water, they thrive even under that conditions. And we had powerful control group where we just watered the plants with regular water and we saw it was more than significant change. That's why and also it's so important
Chunk 60/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  plants with an l. M. Water, their resilience to stress increases exponentially. So even we actually created a short turned drought. We did many things to it that would actually destroy the plant that would really make it hard for it. But if you water the plant with
Chunk 59/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  We proved that we actually, we used these latest fluorescence based technology that can capture what happens within a plant on a molecular level. We got mountain of data. And just by watering the plant, we got a lot of data.
Chunk 58/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  persist, it just remains in this highly, highly structured state. And that's why, you know, we did, we saw this amazing effect on, on basically every living thing. I mean, this latest plan study that we did.
Chunk 57/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  rodent narrowly stable of the just one treatment it just persists and we did many things to it we did things that usually turn water into deeper chaos but for some extraordinary reason this water
Chunk 56/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  We now did like for six consecutive years now we're doing every single year we're doing a new test of water that was treated just once. So after six years it never went out of the state of coherence. So it's extremely
Chunk 55/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  after a very short period of time, what a molecule was break and they go back to chaos. So it was necessary to create stable coherent water because this is where an dilemma really, really, really shines. We are now going to go back to the point where we're going
Chunk 54/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  So it's kind of very not practical and hardly doable and not even that as I mentioned, even if you do a bottling plant, they are water bottling plant and you take it to people. Again, as soon as you take it out, it
Chunk 53/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  a source of water, stream or well of water, within very short kind of walk, it's just not possible to get to even to find that you really have to go remotely somewhere in the jungle.
Chunk 52/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  He offered back to people so that everyone would actually experience the effects of it, the way nature intended. So it's very hard to find that and if people find that kind of...
Chunk 51/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  all, like you mentioned, modernization with all the negative effects with it, that balance, that harmony got actually destroyed. So something was necessary to bring it back and to be
Chunk 50/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  Usually, you know, when you have a free-flowing water, it has this left and right vortexes, which actually keep water in this particular natural state. But due to everything that has been happening, the whole world.
Chunk 49/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  non-native electromagnetic fields and toxins in our environment and things like this, even most rivers and bodies of water that would have previously been in a coherent state are no longer in a coherent state. Exactly. Exactly.
Chunk 48/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  about the coherent water so you were saying that Mother Earth is the hidden voice behind this whole project and is is that mean that because of let's say modernization and
Chunk 47/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  because the EMFs really put water into chaotic state. It really kind of depends the whole effect. But sorry, lost my chain of thought. Well, no, it's okay. We are talking about
Chunk 46/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  molecules break and the water goes back to chaos. So to be honest, we feel that Mother Earth is the hidden voice of this whole project because it was necessary due to toxins, EMFs, all kinds of things we can talk about EMFs as well.
Chunk 45/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  How can we describe the water that is inside of this one? There are very, very, very few places on the planet where you can actually find water in that particular state. And as soon as you take the water out, water might be a little bit more.
Chunk 44/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  a few different types of sleeves that you can put it in. But so when we say coherent water, are we talking about actual mimicry, if you will, of water in a stream or how...
Chunk 43/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  or on the Jedi side because it's not green or red, but it's just clear water. I think it's encapsulated in a quartz encasing, correct me if I'm wrong. Yes. Yeah, with a little metal bottom, so it literally does look like a lightsaber and it comes in.
Chunk 42/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  Could we say that the coherent water that is in this wand my wife actually brought it to me. So this is what it looks like for the people that are on video for the people that are not on video it looks like a clear lightsaber. So I don't know if it's on the sits.
Chunk 41/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  much much much bigger impact and power. The same thing is with water. Incredible. Incredible. So when you mentioned that this is water as nature or as God intended it to be
Chunk 40/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  take five of what laser. So laser of the same power, which is a coherent form of light, you can drill a hole through your table. So the power is the same. But when light enters into coherent state, it has...
Chunk 39/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  are truly extraordinary. To explain the concept of people, again, in maybe a way people can understand, is like if you take a five watt light bulb, it will give you some light. But if you take a five watt bulb,
Chunk 38/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  in only two months. So with just watering the soil with an LM water, that piece of soil became fertile again. We are also going to go into that study in a little while, but effects of it are
Chunk 37/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  with plants. We actually treated this is also fascinating. We actually took completely dead piece of soil destroyed by glyphoseneral other toxins. It's barren. You couldn't grow anything on it. And we revived it completely.
Chunk 36/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  So when you drink this water, there is incredible effect. Short-term and long-term, and we did both, and we're going to jump into the science with a double-blind placebo control studies where we prove this. The same thing happens when we're in the lab.
Chunk 35/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  And through this unique process, when this happens, the true power of water is being unleashed. The true effect, the way we see it is how nature intended the water to be in the first place.
Chunk 34/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  exist in what we call a full spectrum coherent state where those same astromylic hills they link together they start to move in unison they start to they enter into harmony so this
Chunk 33/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  So it's still H2O, but those H2O molecules are moving randomly, they're actually crashing into each other constantly, but since all of this is happening on an atomic level nobody's really aware of that. We found that water can exist in the water.
Chunk 32/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  to make a couple of steps back just to explain the concept of coherent water. We realized in our early research that water currently exists in what we call a chaotic state.
Chunk 31/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  of plants like skyrocket, especially when you compare it to regular water and then watering plants with regular water. So there we realized okay there is something truly special happening here.
Chunk 30/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  We realized that when you water plants with coherent water with an LEMO water, we saw between 60 and 200 percent increase in biofault and emissions. So the vitality of the LEMO is that the LEMO is a very important part of the LEMO.
Chunk 29/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  re-biological system exudes. The more biophotons of biological system exudes more vitality it has. So we actually had a huge green house in the Netherlands where we played with plants. And,
Chunk 28/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  living thing. So very early on they saw that when you change the water, everything else changed. With this bio photon technology, bio photons are these tiny particles of light that every
Chunk 27/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  over 50 plus scientists or three continents and many millions of dollars invested in this incredible thing which really has incredible power to change biology again of basically every
Chunk 26/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  the mental thing. And very early, they actually picked up a whole lab of a famous German scientist, Dr. Fritz Elbert Pop, who developed this bio-photan technology. And all of the scientists just so you know this is now 15 years in research.
Chunk 25/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  even more than that. And they, for the lack of the better word, they wanted to find the secret to life. They wanted to see what moves life, so to speak. What is the most fun
Chunk 24/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  super happy and grateful to be a part of the whole thing. So where it all started. It's actually very interesting. Doves Anting and Dr. Eklarker, they came together many years ago now. It's like 15 years ago or more.
Chunk 23/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  We tested it on humans, we tested it on humans, animals, plants, and we actually found incredible impact on the environment as well, which we are going to go in all of these details.
Chunk 22/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  then you just want to do it justice. As me, I'm the CEO of Anon Water, and I just want to do whatever is in my power to bring this to as much people as possible so that people can get the benefit. We actually tested it on plant-based plants.
Chunk 21/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  companies about is really bringing when we realized that water is the most fundamental level of our existence and when you change that entire biology of basically anything changes.
Chunk 20/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  Thank you so much for having me really named several people which I'm a huge fan of so I'm just super super happy and super grateful to be part of this project and what are all for entire
Chunk 19/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  and sort of updating my new audience, all the new people that we have on this incredible product. So let's just start with the very beginning of Annelema and how it came about. First of all, thank you so much for having me.
Chunk 18/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  I were blown away by your products and what you guys have done with the animal one and some other products you're creating and i'm good friends with Luke story and he is raving about all that you guys do so. That's why i'm here having this conversation again.
Chunk 17/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  But after speaking with you guys last two and a halfish years ago, it really, really, really blew me away. And then two people that I trust quite a bit, Dr. Andy Kaufman and Dr. Tom Cowan.
Chunk 16/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  health. But so when I was first sent to Anna Limowand, I was extremely skeptical because it's like, what is this little lightsaber looking thing that I'm holding and what is this doing with my water?
Chunk 15/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  with use, extruding forks and then maybe a couple of other things. But generally, I like to call myself a natural health maximalist just to where, you know, using sunlight breath movement, feeling my feelings and putting my feet on the earth and things like this to maintain my
Chunk 14/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  I almost feel like I should have mine with me just to show that I do, but I do twirl my anilimewand at least 40 seconds every time I pour a glass of water and I use my aqua cure a little bit. I use my bio charger a little bit. I lean
Chunk 13/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  Two years, a little more than two years, I think since I spoke to you last. And I've said this a number of times on the show, I'm not a huge product sky. There is a few products that I use consistently. And.
Chunk 12/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  Mario, it's been about...
Chunk 11/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  .
Chunk 10/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  you can just head to the show notes to become a member. So thanks for tuning in. You're gonna love this episode. I know I did and you can listen to me just geek out and smile ear to ear about water for the next hour and a half. Thanks.

Chunk 7/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  so many ways and it has so many incredible implications for the future that just, yeah, you'll have to see for yourself or hear for yourself. It's an incredible conversation. So if you're interested in sharing,
Chunk 6/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  I've talked to Mario before, but this episode blew me away. Truly what they're doing at Annelema is totally paradigm shifting and so on.
Chunk 5/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  anytime I make a glass of water at home and I genuinely mean that I use this literally anytime I make a glass of water at home. I use this during my water fast and I discussed the results of my water fast in episode 75 if you're interested. But I would
Chunk 4/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  the health of our soil, our food and really for the entire earth. This little thing is a game changer. I mean that. It's one of those episodes where I say wow like 100 times. I use this in
Chunk 3/337 transcribed. Transcript so far:  for health and the nature of reality. In this episode, we discussed both, and it blew me away. We discussed the science behind this little thing right here, this product as well as the other products that they have, and the beautiful implications for our health.
